    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "Diabetes mellitus (aka diabetes) is a metabolic disease wherein glucose metabolism is uncontrolled as a result of insufficient insulin activity (“Diabetes,” 2018). According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], after ingesting and digesting food, glucose enters the blood, increasing blood glucose concentrations (2016). Under normal conditions, high blood glucose concentrations induce insulin production, which signals glucose transportation to various cells for energy and/or storage and to regulate and maintain normal blood glucose levels (NIDDK, 2016). There are many types of diabetes, such as type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (Egan & Dinneen, 2022).  Because of the dataset’s limitations, however, this project will only try to predict whether a patient does or does not have diabetes without specifying the type.  Knowing whether a person is diabetic or not is important because it can result in strokes, heart and/or kidney diseases, eye problems, nerve damage, and many more (NIDDK, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose glucose concentration, blood pressure, and BMI because these are the most indicative of diabetes diagnosis. Glucose cannot be regulated and maintained with insufficient insulin activity, so high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) are one of the major symptoms of diabetes (Watkins, 1982). Diabetes also damages kidneys and small blood vessels, resulting in high blood pressure (NewYork-Presbyterian, n.d.). Also, obesity (or high BMI) is associated with higher risks of developing diabetes (Bays et al., 2007). \n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, we would like to answer the question: Can we use the observations taken by NIDDK to predict whether a female patient has diabetes or not? \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we used is taken from Kaggle and is originally from NIDDK which researches on chronic diseases to analyze their causes and effects (NIDDK, 2016). The research was conducted using the diagnostic records of female patients, ages 21 years old and more, and of Pima Indian heritage (NIDDK, 2016). The 9 variables in the dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant \n",
    "2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours (determined using an oral glucose tolerance test)\n",
    "3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) \n",
    "4. SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) \n",
    "5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) \n",
    "6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) \n",
    "7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function \n",
    "8. Age: Age (years) \n",
    "9. Outcome: Class variable (0 (no diabetes) or 1 (has diabetes))"

    "## Discussion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary of what we found:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the k-nn algorithm with the predictors “Glucose”, “BloodPressure”, and “BMI”, we can predict whether a subject has diabetes or not with an accuracy of 69.02174%. This prediction accuracy is alright, but it definitely would need to be improved, especially if this prediction model were to be used as an actual diagnostic for diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also found that the K value to perform our classification is k = 2 for it has the highest prediction accuracy. This is a low K, meaning that variables in our data may have complex interactions that the KNN algorithm was struggling with, leading to an overfitting prediction model. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Discussion whether this is what we expected to find:__\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the literature BMI, blood pressure, and glucose are all factors that contribute to diabetes symptomatology. Therefore, we expected a prediction model using these predictors to have a high accuracy of correct predictions due to the scientific evidence of an interaction between diabetes and BMI, blood pressure, and glucose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the KNN classification model did not have as high of a prediction accuracy as expected. There are many possible reasons this could have been the case. There may be complex interactions between our predictors that complicate the relationships between the predictors and the outcome. Further, since there is quite a bit of overlap of outcome clusters that can be seen visually in plots “diabetes_bp_plot” and “diabetes_bmi_plot”, the decision boundaries are not very well defined, and the KNN  algorithm may not have been ideal for this type of dataset. It is possible that we chose predictors that are all mediated by the same physiological mechanisms and therefore have too much overlap and are too similar. Additionally, it is possible that the dataset was noisy and that impacted the classification model and accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Impact of our findings:__\n",
    "\n",
    "With our classification model having a 69% prediction accuracy, we are moving in the right direction to eventually be able to use the KNN algorithm as a diagnostic for diabetes. This could help doctors and patients alike as doctors would have a “second opinion” in the algorithm and it could potentially take over the doctor’s role in diagnosing diabetes altogether which could save their time and use it instead to do related research or treat other patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Future questions or research:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research questions could address what better predictors (whether common or not) and what combination of these predictors could be used to predict diabetes at a higher accuracy. Additionally, future research could study what percentage accuracy would be high enough for a classification prediction model to be adequately accurate and be used in healthcare settings. Also, future research could study the usage of computer algorithms as diagnostic criteria and determine how effective and trusted these algorithms are in practice with real patients. Such would allow healthcare professionals to allot their time to finding significant preventions, cures, or hereditary or independent causes that greatly affect diabetes diagnosis and allow for better treatment."
